# Emotion-Detection-from-speech
This project detects human emotions from speech using MFCC feature extraction and a Random Forest Classifier. It can identify emotions such as happy, sad, angry, calm, fearful, and neutral. A Streamlit web app is included for real-time emotion detection through microphone input, making the system easy to use and interactive.

# Emotion Detection from Speech 🎤  

This project focuses on detecting **human emotions from speech** using **Machine Learning techniques**. By analyzing audio features such as **MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)**, the system classifies emotions into categories like **Happy, Sad, Angry, Calm, Fearful, and Neutral**.  
It also provides a **Streamlit Web Application** that allows real-time predictions through microphone input, making the system both interactive and practical.
